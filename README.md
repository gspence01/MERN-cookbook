# MERN Cookbook

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## General
I am making a PERN stack application using pgAdmin, Express, React (and React Bootstrap), and Node.js for SDSU Digital Skills milestone project. I've decided to create a webiste that holds recipies from my family's country to showcase what we have learned so far in class.

## Tech
for this project, I will be using React and React bootstrap for the styling and pgAdmin for the database. I routed the server with Express.

## Things to add in the future
I'm a procrastinator and, admittingly, I have not gotten as far as I would have wished with this application. In the future, outside of this project, I would love to create more RESTful functionality, i.e. creating an update page to update the contents of a recipe and a form to create new recipes. I would also like to research more into API structure to enhance what I have so far. As of now, the API is pretty slow and I have encountered bugs while trying to fetch data, as the promise would resolve long after the components started loading. Furthermore, I would like to add more styling to make the website look more legitimate. For now, though, this is what I got. :D
